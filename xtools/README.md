# XTOOLS XBE
## Features
XTOOLS is a tool which allow specific Xenium related things.
  * Write 2MB Blue/Ice/Gold Xenium OS flash dumps to a Xenium Device.
  * Toggle the RGB LED as a simple test.

## Building
 * Install [NXDK](https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk) and its dependencies.
 * Set NXDK_DIR path `export NXDK_DIR=/path/to/nxdk`
 * Compile xenium-tools using `make` from within the xenium-tools directory.
 * This will generate an xbe which you need to transfer to your Xbox.

## XeniumOS flash images Included!
 * To the best of my belief the inlcuded XeniumOS flash contains NO copyright code.
 * All included XeniumOS flash images are BLANK and contain NO XBOX bios images.
 * The XeniumOS loader is Cromwell (Linux) based and XeniumOS has no copyright notices.
